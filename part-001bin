Pacific Region Quarterly
 
 
 Welcome to the Summer Edition of the Pacific Region Quarterly! Our region continues to lead the nation in lending this fiscal year, with nearly $3.4 billion approved to over 6,619 small businesses.  The region encompasses California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam.  SBA lending continues to increase, providing capital to small businesses at a steadily growing pre-recession pace. To help our nation recover from the biggest recession since the Great Depression, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) stepped in and supported more than $79 billion to more than 150,000 small businesses since 2009.  To make this possible, we brought more than 1,000 community lenders back to SBA lending for the first time since 2007 and we secured a $20 billion commitment to increase small business lending over the next three years from 13 of the largest banks.  
Recognizing that there are still gaps in the marketplace, SBA and the Obama Administration introduced new initiatives to fill the gaps and provide more access and opportunity.  This month, Administrator Mills was in Quantico, VA to launch Operation Boots to Business [ http://www.sba.gov/about-sba-services/7367/160611 ], an SBA initiative to help train and raise the entrepreneurial awareness among the 250,000 service members transitioning out of the military every year.  President Obama also directed federal agencies to pay small business contractors and subcontractors in 15 days instead of 30 [ http://www.sba.gov/about-sba-services/7367/23861 ].  This accelerates the cash flow a business needs to operate and grow.  Last month, SBA simplified portions of the Small Loan Advantage (SLA) program [ http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/priming-lending-pump-small-business-sla-20 ], expanded the number of qualified lenders and increased the loan cap. In addition to these initiatives, we're also creating new strategic alliances, including one with AARP to provide counseling and training to entrepreneurs over the age of 50 who want to start or grow a small business (see article below for details).
The SBA celebrated Small Business Week in May.  Small Business Week is an opportunity to honor and recognize the contributions of small business owners and champions in our communities and on our economy.*  *In Washington, D.C., several small business owners and champions from the region claimed national honors.  I also had the opportunity to participate in local Small Business Week events around the region.  The photos below include several Small Business Week honorees.   
We'd love to hear how SBA has helped your business start and grow!  Feel free to send us a note <%20christopher.lorenzana@sba.gov>.

*       Obama Administration* Takes *Immediate Actions to Help Small Businesses*
The President believes that entrepreneurs and small businesses are engines of innovation and economic growth.  They're leading the effort in our nation's economic recovery.  This is why the Obama Administration has worked to enact 18 small business tax cuts and numerous measures to help more small businesses access the credit they need to invest, hire, and grow.    The Obama Administration announced earlier this month several additional initiatives that build on this record of progress and will help our nation’s small businesses expand and create jobs.  Five of these initiatives are immediate executive actions that will accelerate federal payments, reduce paperwork, and make it easier for small firms to access loans and tax credits, and one is a legislative proposal to raise the amount of investment small businesses can expense next year.(1)   _Accelerate payments to small business subcontractors:_  Through the Office of Management and Budget, the President will direct agencies to make contract payments along an accelerated timeline to all prime contractors for the next year (typically 15 days after receipt of proper documentation, as opposed to 30 days), with the understanding that those prime contractors will similarly accelerate payments to their small business subcontractors. (2)   _Announce support for Section 179 expensing at $250,000 for one year (requires legislation):_ President Obama is calling on Congress to let small businesses write off up to $250,000 in capital investments in 2013, such as machinery and equipment, to drive productivity. This builds on the President’s proposal for 100% expensing for all firms in 2012. Because an increase in Section 179 expensing was part of the 2001 / 2003 tax cuts, this proposal is included in the President’s call for extending those tax cuts for the middle class next year. Without that extension, the expensing limit for small businesses is scheduled to decline to only $25,000 in 2013.    (3)  _ Increase access to capital through SBA’s Small Loan Advantage (SLA) 2.0:_ SBA is re-launching Small Loan Advantage, one of its key small dollar loan products, as SLA 2.0.  This revamped program raises the maximum loan amount from $250,000 to $350,000, streamlines the loan process, and makes it easier for lenders to extend loans to small businesses across America.  (4)   _Launch “Quick App” for surety bond guarantees under $250,000:_ SBA is launching “QuickApp,” a streamlined application that will eliminate the need for contractors to complete five unnecessary forms to apply for surety bonds.  Providing small firms, particularly in the construction industry, streamlined access to these bonds will make it easier for them to compete for and win additional business, which is important to allowing them to expand and create jobs.    (5)   _Reduce paperwork for SBA’s Disaster Loan Program:_ Cutting the online application from 80 screens to three or four screens (depending on loan type) will allow families and businesses easier and quicker access to support for rebuilding after a disaster.  Homeowners, renters, businesses and non-profits applying for disaster loans to cover losses to real estate and property, as well as economic injury, can access the form here [ https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela/ ].(6)   _Align New Markets Tax Credit with the needs of investors in growing small firms:_ The Obama Administration is working on a set of regulatory reforms to the existing New Markets Tax Credit that will make it easier for community development entities (CDEs) to attract private sector funds for investment in startups and small businesses operating in lower‐income communities.  The forthcoming regulations are designed to encourage CDEs to invest in other types of small local businesses by relaxing the reinvestment requirements for CDEs investing in certain operating businesses.  The Treasury Department is also considering regulatory reforms that would further simplify the requirements for these CDEs and intends to publish these for comment in the future.   ________________________________________________________________________

Boots To Business logo
                   Operation Boots to Business:  From Service to Startup
Entrepreneurship and small business ownership are key opportunities for service members as they transition into civilian life.  There are over 250,000 service members each year transitioning out of the military.  Transitioning veterans are natural entrepreneurs, possessing the training, experience, and leadership skills to start businesses and create jobs.   More than 2 million businesses in the U.S. are owned by veterans and they employ almost 6 million people. The SBA recognizes the contributions that veterans make by owning and running businesses that employ millions of Americans.  We believe there's more that can be done to support more veterans so they can grow businesses and create jobs.  That's why we partnered with our resource partners (Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), Women’s Business Centers (WBCs), SCORE, and Veterans Business Opportunity Centers (VBOCs)) and Syracuse University, to launch the Boots to Business program.  Region IX is proud to be home to two of the four pilot program locations- Camp Pendleton (CA) and Twenty-Nine Palms (CA).Boots to Business will provide transitioning service members with the knowledge, tools and resources they need to evaluate opportunities and become successful entrepreneurs as they transition out of the military.  We will help them get started, and introduce them to our partner network for support throughout the life-cycle of their new businesses.  The Boots to Business program will use a multi-phase approach to introduce transitioning service members to the fundamentals of small business ownership and to the SBA tools and resources available to them.  The goal is to provide entrepreneurship awareness and opt-in training nationwide to the 250,000 transitioning service members from all branches of the military by 2013.________________________________________________________________________

                                               SBA and AARP Team Up
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) are launching a strategic alliance to provide counseling and training to entrepreneurs over the age of 50 who want to start or grow a small business.  Through SBA’s online training courses and its nationwide network of business mentors and counselors, the two organizations expect to train 100,000 “encore entrepreneurs,” men and women over 50 who are starting or running a small business.SBA has set up a dedicated web page for Americans over the age of 50 featuring: an online self-assessment tool that will help potential small business owners understand their readiness for starting a business as well as information to help with business planning, shaping a winning business idea, professional counseling, financial services and information to find local resources in your area.  This web page can be found at:http://www.sba.gov/content/50-entrepreneurs.SBA and AARP also will jointly develop and host a customized online course, self-assessment, and webinar series for older entrepreneurs.  SBA already offers a suite of online courses for people who want to start and grow their business. To take a course, go to http://www.sba.gov/training under “online courses.”  Course topics include start-up basics, finance strategies, marketing tactics, overseas trade, and more. For more than 70 million Americans over 50, business ownership is a practical option.  It can be a second career or a chance to leverage life experiences into an interesting and financially practical “encore” career.________________________________________________________________________
